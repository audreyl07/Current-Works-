## Course Notes PDF Summarizer 
This project works as a way to summarize textbook chapters into short, concise summaries that are easy to read, have examples and are more understandable than a block of text. Also no one has time to be reading a textbook when you can just make something to do the hard reading for you. 

### Features 
- Extracts and splits texts from PDFs
- Uses the K-means clustering algorithm to help improve relevance and speed
- Employs an LLM (llama3.1:8b), via Ollama to summarize the text
- Highlights code examples in the summaries
- Can combine the old pdf reports with new summaries
